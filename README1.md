🧾 Platform Overview

TaxCortex is a FinTech-based Smart Income Tax Calculation and Financial Planning Platform designed for Indian taxpayers, fully compliant with Income Tax Rules for FY 2025–26. It focuses on accurate, transparent, and optimized tax planning for individuals and families.

🎯 Core Approach

Unlike investment-centric FinTech platforms that treat taxation as a secondary feature, TaxCortex follows a tax-first, compliance-driven approach. It prioritizes correct income tax computation over trading or portfolio management.

💼 Income & Tax Computation

TaxCortex calculates exact tax liability by aggregating multiple real-world income sources, including:

Salary

Rental income

Capital gains

Freelance / business income

Dividends and interest

It supports both Old and New Tax Regimes, provides side-by-side comparison, and recommends the most tax-efficient option based on actual savings.

📈 Tax Optimization & Investments

The platform integrates investment planning with taxation, offering actionable recommendations under:

Section 80C

Section 80CCD(1B)

HRA

Standard deduction

This enables users to legally minimize their tax burden.

👨‍👩‍👧 Family Tax Planning

A key differentiator of TaxCortex is Family Tax Planning, allowing:

Tax calculation for Individuals, Senior Citizens, and Super Senior Citizens

Household-level tax comparison and optimization

This feature is rarely available in existing FinTech solutions.

📅 Advance Tax & Historical Analysis

Monthly and quarterly advance tax tracking

Penalty avoidance under Sections 234B and 234C

Historical tax analysis to track income growth, tax trends, and effective tax rates across financial years

🔐 Privacy & Reporting

Client-side calculations only

No login, KYC, or third-party tracking

Sensitive data remains on the user’s device

Professional PDF and JSON exports for records and CA consultation

🚀 Scalability & Deployment

Built with modern web technologies and a clean dashboard, TaxCortex is scalable, extensible, and suitable for both real-world deployment and enterprise-grade financial systems.
